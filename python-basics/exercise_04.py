# Exercise 
# Create a program to calculate volume of a cylinder ,cube, 

pi = 3.14
radius = 12 # in cms 
height = 20 # cm

vol = pi * radius * radius * height 
print(vol)

area = pi * radius * radius
print(area)


# Create a program to calculate the surface area of a cylinder 


s_area = ( 2 * pi * radius * radius ) + (pi * radius * height)
print(s_area)
