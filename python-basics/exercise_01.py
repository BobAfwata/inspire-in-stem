# Integers - Positive ,Negative Whole numbers 

x = 10

# float are decimal point numbers 

fuel_level = 13.24
# Characters : alphanumeric characters ,numbers ,keyboard special characters 
my_grade = 'A'

# String 
my_name = "Bob Afwata "
# String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:

x = "John"
# is the same as
x = 'John'
# Python Casting - Converting one type to another ie into to a string 

x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0



# Python Numbers 

#Integers : Positive and negative whole numbers 
y = 3
x = 2 

sum = x + y
dif = x - y 
prod = x * y
quot = x / y 
mod = x % y 

pow = y ** x  # y **2  raised to power 
print(" x + y = ", sum)
print(" x - y = ", dif)
print(" x * y = ", prod)
print(" x / y = ", quot)
print(" x % y = ", mod)
print(" x ^ y = ", pow)



# Floats  : any number with a decimal point a float
